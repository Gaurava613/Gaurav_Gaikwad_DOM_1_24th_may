This GitHub repository presents an enticing image gallery crafted using HTML and CSS, employing either a flex or grid layout. The gallery features four images aligned in a single row, each with unique interactive capabilities. Clicking the initial image unveils a registration form where users can enter their name, email, and username. Subsequently, clicking the second image reveals the name and username of the registered user. The third image, featuring a dice, allows users to roll it thrice, generating random values ranging from 1 to 6. If the sum of these values surpasses 10, it enables access to click on the fourth image, which generates a randomly generated 12-digit coupon code with an aesthetically pleasing design. Crucially, each image is clickable only once, and they must be clicked sequentially. Should the user fail to achieve a sum greater than 10 on the third image after two attempts, a 'Bad luck' message is displayed. Conversely, successfully obtaining a 12-digit coupon code triggers a congratulatory message and image. Enjoy the interactive gallery experience!
